Imports Tamsoft models into blender
Testing on Senran Kagura Estival Versus models
Most parts was reversed by my self
Some parts was adviced by [Random Talking Bush](https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-29836.html). Thx bro, you saves bones tips
I'm using linux, so modify windows paths by your self. Sory win guys
whats works:
-cat file parser
-mesh parser (with bones)
-texture parser
whats in plan:
-animations
-armatures mergin (when you customize your character)
-mesh reading algorithm optimzation (it realy suck on huge model > 10mb)
    
#how to load character poperly
1.load some bra (texture only)
2.load face
3.load hair
4.load body

to load new body - remove textures and shaders
